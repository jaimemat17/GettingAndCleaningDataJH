## Feature Selection 

Same subject is measured several times for each activity. 

The features selected for this database come from files: 
- data/activity_labels.txt -> Includes relation between the activity number and the activity name.
- data/features.txt -> Name of all features in X_train.txt and X_test.txt in the same column order .
- data/train/X_train.txt -> features for training.
- data/train/Y_train.txt -> labels (activity) for training. Each row is related to a subject and an activity.
- data/train/subject_train.txt -> list of training subjects in same row order as it is in training X and Y files. 
- data/test/X_test.txt -> features for testing. Each row is related to a subject and an activity.
- data/test/Y_test.txt -> labels (activity) for testing. Each row is related to a subject and an activity.
- data/test/subject_test.txt -> list of training subjects in same row order as it is in test X and Y files. 

The different measurements has been averaged grouped by Subject and Activity. The resulting columns included in the dataset are:

"Subject" -> Subject being measured
"Activity" -> Activity being performed

All the following columns are the average of several measurements of those features for a subject performing an activity:
